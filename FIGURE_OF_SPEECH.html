        <h3><b><u>1. SIMILE</u></b></h3>
        <b>Simile</b> is nothing but comparison between two very different objects. While comparing we need to use
        comparitive words: like, as etc.
        <b><i>For example:</i></b>
        As red as blood, he fought like a lion.
        Her face ashen like that of a corpse <br>
        <h3><b><u>2. METAPHOR </u></b></h3>
        It is almost similar to a simile but here we take it for granted that both the objects are same. In short, we
        can call it an implied simile. In metaphor while comparing we do not use comparative words. <b>For example:</b>

        She was the lioness in the battle field.

        Life is a dream.<br>
        <b><u>Let’s take up an example to clear the difference between a metaphor and a simile.</u></b><br>

        Sachin played like a warrior (simile)

        Sachin was a warrior in the game (Metaphor) <br>
        <h3><b><u>3. PERSONIFICATION</u></b></h3>
        Here a motionless object (like a table) is spoken as if it has life.

        <b>For example:</b> trees sprinting

        A roadside stand that too pathetically pled….. <br>

        <h3><b><u>4. APOSTROPHE</u></b></h3>
        Hey you little teddy bear, does she love me? Don’t take my wrong, this is what Apostrophe actually is. It’s when
        an author or poet directs a speech towards an abstract object or an imaginary person.

        <b>For example:</b> Well hello jet plane! <br>

        <h3><b><u>4. OXYMORON</u></b></h3>
        In this figure of speech, two contradictory terms are combined together. It’s derived from a Greek word which
        literally means “Sharp dull”.

        <b>For example:</b> Greedy good-doers, beneficient beasts of prey <br>

        <h3><b><u>5. IRONY</u></b></h3>
        This one is the most commonly used of all in our day-to-day conversations. Irony is a form where the literal
        meaning is completely opposite to what is conveyed by the author or the poet.

        <b>For example:</b> Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid

        This is taken from Aunt Jennifer’s tigers and it brings forth a sense of irony because the tigers are much
        stronger than the woman who created them.

        I’ve tried getting examples from NCERT textbooks so that you can relate them while you’re going through the
        poems. <br>

        <h3><b><u>6. REPETITION</u></b></h3>
        In this, there is a repetition of a word in a sentence.

        <b>For example:</b> it was so so unexpected. <br>
        <h3><b><u>7. ALLITERATION</u></b></h3>
        Repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words or stressed syllables.

        <b>For example:</b> Oh, wild west wind!<br>
        <h3><b><u>8. HYPERBOLE</u></b></h3>
        In this, extreme exaggeration is made.

        <b>For example:</b> I have told you a million times. <br>
